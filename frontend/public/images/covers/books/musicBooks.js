        description:
          "This Book covers many aspects about the wonderful art form known as Music. It has been said that music is a language which can express virtually unlimited concepts and emotions. If you want to 'make music', there are definite things that need to be learned. However, you don't need to master all of them to have fun making music. As a matter of fact, you can learn a couple simple things and begin to make music in a few minutes. Then, depending on how far you want to take it, you can continue to learn more. This Book answers many interesting questions such as: * What is music really? * What is musicianship? * What is music theory? * What are melody, harmony, rhythm? * Can anyone learn to play music? * What are the 3 important elements of sound? * What is 'tone deafness' and can it be cured? * What is 'perfect pitch' and can it be learned? And many more!",

          'Excerpt from What We Hear in Music: A Laboratory Course of Study in Music History and Appreciation for Four Years of High School, Academy, College, Music Club or Home Study In this Course of Study for High Schools, it has been the earnest desire of the author and the publishers to contribute a well-organized plan for the study of music in a broadly cultural style, looking toward giving a working knowledge of the literature of music, rather than a theoretical study of the form and grammar of the subject. The study of high school music must be arranged to attract, hold and Educate every boy and girl, regardless of whether they can sing or not, and should furnish opportunity, material and instruction that will enable them to become, not professional musicians, but music lovers and appreciative, intelligent listeners, knowing the worlds music just as they know the history, prose, poetry and art. Music, when properly taught, stands for as much mental development and general culture as any other subject in the curriculum, and should receive the same credits toward graduation from the local school, and as entrance requirements in the Colleges and Universities. To-day the trend of music study is strongly toward appreciation, rather than theory. It is impossible, however, to study appreciation or interpretation without Real Music to interpret and appreciate. Heretofore, the ideals of high school pupils in music have been virtually limited to the music they, themselves, could produce, thus restricting their observation to a very narrow field. Now the Victor and Victor-Victrola, with the wonderful list of Victor Records, which is regularly augmented each month, makes it possible to present the whole subject in a vital form, as it brings within the hearing of every pupil the real music to be studied and analyzed in consecutive lessons, starting at a given point, progressing systematically, and arriving at a legitimate conclusion.

        description:
          'How does popular music produce its subject? How does it produce us as subjects? More specifically, how does it do this through voice--through "giving voice"? And how should we understand this subject--"the people"--that it voices into existence? Is it singular or plural? What is its history and what is its future? Voicing the Popular draws on approaches from musical interpretation, cultural history, social theory and psychoanalysis to explore key topics in the field, including race, gender, authenticity and repetition. Taking most of his examples from across the past hundred years of popular music development--but relating them to the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century "pre-history"--Richard Middleton constructs an argument that relates "the popular" to the unfolding of modernity itself. Voicing the Popular renews the case for ambitious theory in musical and cultural studies, and, against the grain of much contemporary thought, insists on the progressive potential of a politics of the Low.',

        description:
          'Departing from the traditional German school of music theorists, Michael Klein injects a unique French critical theory perspective into the framework of music and meaning. Using primarily Lacanian notions of the symptom, that unnamable jouissance located in the unconscious, and the registers of subjectivity (the Imaginary, the Symbolic Order, and the Real), Klein explores how we understand music as both an artistic form created by "the subject" and an artistic expression of a culture that imposes its history on this modern subject. By creatively navigating from critical theory to music, film, fiction, and back to music, Klein distills the kinds of meaning that we have been missing when we perform, listen to, think about, and write about music without the insights of Lacan and others into formulations of modern subjectivity.',

The examination of literary works using music as an analogy for literary composition and agent of cultural value, and the consideration of musical works whose structure is derived from literary models will excite the interest of both professional scholars and students in the fields of musicology, literary studies and modern European languages.

        subtitle: 'The Reception of Instrumental Virtuosity, c. 1815–c. 1850',
        authors: ['Zarko Cvejić'],
        publisher: 'Cambridge Scholars Publishing',
        publishedDate: '2016-06-22',
        description:
          'This book offers a novel interpretation of the sudden and steep decline of instrumental virtuosity in its critical reception between c. 1815 and c. 1850, documenting it with a large number of examples from Europe’s leading music periodicals at the time. The increasingly hostile critical reception of instrumental virtuosity during this period is interpreted from the perspective of contemporary aesthetics and philosophical conceptions of human subjectivity; the book’s main thesis is that virtuosity qua irreducibly bodily performance generated so much hostility because it was deemed incompatible with, and even threatening to, the new Romantic philosophical conception of music as a radically disembodied, abstract, autonomous art and, moreover, a symbol or model – if only a utopian one – of a similarly autonomous and free human subject, whose freedom and autonomy seemed increasingly untenable in the economic and political context of post-Napoleonic Europe. That is why music, newly reconceived as radically abstract and autonomous, plays such an important part in the philosophy of early German Romantics such as E. T. A. Hoffmann, Schelling, and Schopenhauer, with their growing misgivings about the very possibility of human freedom, and not so much in the preceding generation of thinkers, such as Kant and Hegel, who still believed in the (transcendentally) free subject of the Enlightenment. For the early German Romantics, music becomes a model of human freedom, if freedom could exist. By contrast, virtuosity, irredeemably moored in the perishable human body, ephemeral, and beholden to such base motives as making money and gaining fame, is not only incompatible with music thus conceived, but also threatens to expose it as an illusion, in other words, as irreducibly corporeal, and, by extension, the human subject it was meant to symbolise as likewise an illusion. Only with that in mind, may we begin to understand the hostility of some early to mid-19th-century critics to instrumental virtuosity, which sometimes reached truly bizarre proportions. In order to accomplish this, the book looks at contemporary aesthetics and philosophy, the contemporary reception of virtuosity in performance and composition, and the impact of 19th-century gender ideology on the reception of some leading virtuosi, male and female alike.',

        description:
          "The question of whether music has meaning has been the subject of sustained debate ever since music became a subject of academic inquiry. Is music a language? Does it communicate specific ideas and emotions? What does music mean, and how does this meaning occur? Kofi Agawu's Music as Discourse has become a standard and definitive work in musical semiotics. Working at the nexus of musicology, ethnomusicology, and music philosophy and aesthetics, Agawu presents a synthetic and innovative approach to musical meaning which argues deftly for the thinking of music as a discourse in itself--composed not only of sequences of gestures, phrases, or progressions, but rather also of the very philosophical and linguistic props that enable the analytical formulations made about music as an object of study. The book provides extensive demonstration of the pertinence of a semiological approach to understanding the fully-freighted language of romantic music, stresses the importance of a generative approach to tonal understanding, and provides further insight into the analogy between music and language. Music as Discourse is an essential read for all who are interested in the theory, analysis and semiotics of music of the romantic period.",

          "What are musical works? Are they discovered or created? Of what elements are they comprised? How are they specified by notations? What makes a performance of one piece and not another? Is it possible to perform old music authentically? Can ethnic music influenced by foreign sources and presented to tourists genuinely reflect the culture's musical and wider values? Can recordings substitute faithfully for live performances? These are the questions considered in Musical Works and Performances. Part One outlines the nature of musical works, their relation to performances, and their notational specification. Works for performance differ from ones that are merely for playback, and pieces for live rendition are unlike those for studio performance. Pieces vary in the number and kind of their constitutive properties. The identity of musical works goes beyond their sonic profile and depends on their music-historical context. To be of a given work, a performance must match its contents by following instructions traceable to its creation. Some pieces are indicated via exemplars, but many are specified notationally. Scores must be interpreted in light of notational conventions and performance practices they assume. Part Two considers authenticity in performance, musical traditions, and recordings. A performance should follow the composer's instructions. Departures from the ideal are tolerable, but faithfulness is central to the enterprise of work performance, not merely an interpretative option. When musical cultures interact, assimilation from within differs from destruction from without. Even music subject to foreign influences can genuinely reflect the musical traditions and social values of a culture, however. Finally, while most works are for live performance, most performances are experienced via recordings, which have their own, distinctive characteristics. This comprehensive and original analysis of musical ontology discusses many kinds of music, and applies its conclusions to issues as diverse as the authentic performance movement, the cultural integrity of ethnic music, and the implications of the dominance of recorded over live music.",

          "Excerpt from What We Hear in Music: A Laboratory Course of Study in Music History and Appreciation for Four Years of High School, Academy, College, Music Club or Home Study The study of high school music must be arranged to attract, hold and educate every boy and girl, regardless of whether they can sing or not, and should furnish opportunity, material and instruction that will enable them to become, not professional musicians, but music lovers and appreciative, intelligent listeners, knowing the world's music just as they know its history, prose, poetry and art. Heretofore, the ideals of high school pupils in music have been virtually limited to the music they themselves could produce, thus restricting their observation to a very narrow field. Music, when properly taught, stands for as much mental develop ment and general culture as any other subject in the curriculum and should receive the same credits toward graduation from the local school, and as entrance requirements in the colleges and universities.

        title: 'The Music of James Bond',
        authors: ['Jon Burlingame'],
        publisher: 'Oxford University Press',
        publishedDate: '2012-11-01',
        description:
          'The story of the music that accompanies the cinematic adventures of Ian Fleming\'s intrepid Agent 007 is one of surprising real-life drama. In The Music of James Bond, author Jon Burlingame throws open studio and courtroom doors alike to reveal the full and extraordinary history of the sounds of James Bond, spicing the story with a wealth of fascinating and previously undisclosed tales. Burlingame devotes a chapter to each Bond film, providing the backstory for the music (including a reader-friendly analysis of each score) from the last-minute creation of the now-famous "James Bond Theme" in Dr. No to John Barry\'s trend-setting early scores for such films as Goldfinger and Thunderball. We learn how synthesizers, disco and modern electronica techniques played a role in subsequent scores, and how composer David Arnold reinvented the Bond sound for the 1990s and beyond. The book brims with behind-the-scenes anecdotes. Burlingame examines the decades-long controversy over authorship of the Bond theme; how Frank Sinatra almost sang the title song for Moonraker; and how top artists like Shirley Bassey, Tom Jones, Paul McCartney, Carly Simon, Duran Duran, Gladys Knight, Tina Turner, and Madonna turned Bond songs into chart-topping hits. The author shares the untold stories of how Eric Clapton played guitar for Licence to Kill but saw his work shelved, and how Amy Winehouse very nearly co-wrote and sang the theme for Quantum of Solace. New interviews with many Bond songwriters and composers, coupled with extensive research as well as fascinating and previously undiscovered details--temperamental artists, unexpected hits, and the convergence of great music and unforgettable imagery--make The Music of James Bond a must read for 007 buffs and all popular music fans. This paperback edition is brought up-to-date with a new chapter on Skyfall.',

          'Seminar paper from the year 2007 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: 1,0, University of Augsburg (Lehrstuhl für Englische Literaturwissenschaft), course: James Joyce - Dubliners, 26 entries in the bibliography, language: English, abstract: „The singing voice, like the speaking voice, masks and betrays the unconscious through combinations of pitch and word. Why sing if not to communicate supplementary information that words alone cannot convey?” Music and Literature have always been influencing each other and quite often music plays an important role in literature. Sometimes it contributes an entertaining or even humoristic factor, occasionally it pushes the action and at times it serves as a mirror of the culture to emphasize emotions and environment of the characters. Joyce’s characters in Dubliners sing and perform when they can no longer speak about their frustrations or passions. Therefore the musical allusions always imply a clash between reality and imagination. What is desired in the song will almost certainly not happen. “In its attributes of direct emotional expressiveness, its allusiveness, its contact with the collective past through folk song and physical rhythm, and in its tremendous emotional range from the banal to the sublime, music offers resources that in certain ways can challenge or surpass spoken language.” In Dubliners Joyce uses music in three distinct ways. Firstly, in a realistic manner to define the real world in which his character live in. Secondly to emphasize the importance of romance and form the background and the texture of their lives and thirdly for the revelation of character because his characters reveal themselves through music.',

          'A Comparative Study Between the Pedagogical Methodologies of Arnold Schoenberg and Nadia Boulanger',
        authors: ['Barrett Ashley Johnson'],

        description:
          'While many teachers of music composition have influenced both the aesthetic and eventual success of their students, few have equaled the contributions of Arnold Schoenberg and Nadia Boulanger in the twentieth-century. A larger volume of a more comprehensive collection including all music composition teachers of the era would serve a certain purpose. However, the unique aspect of the current text examines, in detail, and herein presented for the first time in print, many of the teaching materials and approaches of these two famed musicians. Selection of these two teachers for comparison was made owing to the musical position so famously attributed to each: Schoenberg’s predilection to the German School; Boulanger’s favoritism to the French/Stravinsky aesthetic. In making the case for both Schoenberg and Boulanger, the Author has chosen two differing philosophies of music education practice of the late twentieth-century and early twenty-first century: those of Bennett Reimer and David Elliott. The Author examines the materials and methods of each Schoenberg and Boulanger in light of each Reimer’s and Elliott’s case for music education philosophy. Among the subjects discussed: the nature of musical creativity, the process and methods of teaching creativity/music, and the teacher/student dynamic, to name a few. In closing, the Author has presented his own suggestions for teachers, or would-be teachers, of music composition in a seven-step process leading to an effective pedagogy of the subject.',

        authors: ['Sarah Reichardt'],
        publisher: 'Routledge',
        publishedDate: '2017-07-05',
        description:
          "Since the publication of Solomon Volkov's disputed memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich, the composer and his music has been subject to heated debate concerning how the musical meaning of his works can be understood in relationship to the composer's life within the Soviet State. While much ink has been spilled, very little work has attempted to define how Shostakovich's music has remained so arresting not only to those within the Soviet culture, but also to Western audiences - even though such audiences are often largely ignorant of the compositional context or even the biography of the composer. This book offers a useful corrective: setting aside biographically grounded and traditional analytical modes of explication, Reichardt uncovers and explores the musical ambiguities of four of the composer‘s middle string quartets, especially those ambiguities located in moments of rupture within the musical structure. The music is constantly collapsing, reversing, inverting and denying its own structural imperatives. Reichardt argues that such confrontation of the musical language with itself, though perhaps interpretable as Shostakovich's own unique version of double-speak, also poignantly articulates the fractured state of a more general form of modern subjectivity. Reichardt employs the framework of Lacanian psychoanalysis to offer a cogent explanation of this connection between disruptive musical process and modern subjectivity. The ruptures of Shostakovich's music become symptoms of the pathologies at the core of modern subjectivity. These symptoms, in turn, relate to the Lacanian concept of the real, which is the empty kernel around which the modern subject constructs reality. This framework proves invaluable in developing a powerful, original hermeneutic understanding of the music. Read through the lens of the real, the riddles written into the quartets reveal the arbitrary and contingent state of the musical subject's constructed reality, reflecting pathologies ende",

This book focuses on music in commercials from an interpretive text analytical perspective, answering hitherto neglected questions: What characterizes music in commercials compared to other commercial music and other music on TV? How does music in commercials relate to music ‘outside’ the universe of commercials? How and what can music in commercials signify? Author Nicolai Graakjær sets a new benchmark for the international scholarly study of music on television and its pervading influence on consumer choice.',

        title: 'An Introduction to the Study of National Music',
        subtitle: 'Comprising Researches Into Popular Songs, Traditions, and Customs',
        authors: ['Carl Engel'],
        publisher: 'CreateSpace',
        publishedDate: '2014-08-30',
        description:
          'IN this interesting volume Herr Carl Engel, to whom the public was already indebted for a treatise on "the Music of the Most Ancient Nations," has given us some preliminary results of an industrious and intelligent search into the subject of national music. Much curious and significant detail has been gathered together in the volume, of the detailed contents of which it is impossible to give an adequate notion in the compass of a short notice; the conclusions which this detail points to are perhaps even still more interesting. It comes out, for instance, unmistakably, though we cannot say it is brought out clearly (Herr Engel\'s power of generalisation being somewhat small), that scales, the bare material of music, are almost infinitely various, and therefore entirely arbitrary. Tonalities of which the degrees proceed by halves of what we call tones, are in common use in many of the less known countries; some savage nations sing in successions of quarter tones; in other countries, again, pitch moves by intervals equal to about one-third of the European whole-tone. The result of Herr Engel\'s book is, in fact, to prove the existence of a number of totally differing musical languages, each intelligible and beautiful to those with whom it is indigenous, and each unmeaning, if not repulsive, to those whose ears have been accustomed to a different one. To an Arab musician, a pianoforte tuned to the European musical scale is "very much out of tune," and "jumps;" the Chinese can find "no soul" in European music, and the European reciprocates the feeling in both cases. An Englishman who, after months of patient practice, has learned to intone what appear to him the unearthly quarter-tone intervals of the New Zealand Maories, is rewarded at length-just as he begins to be able to make noises which would frighten a dog in London-by the naive compliment from his teachers that they will now "soon make a singer of him." It would seem, from all this, that the raw material of art-work in sound is entirely arbitrary; and that, whatever succession of intervals be adopted as a scale, the human ear accepts them, and finds pleasure in art-work based upon them. We cannot follow Herr Engel when he recommends to European musical composers the use of a variety of tonalities in their works; there may be special points of excellence and beauty in other than the European scales, but for a composer to incorporate into a symphony passages founded upon these scales, could have no possible result but confusion. It would mean nothing either to European, Asiatic, or Chinaman. As well might we recommend an author to use hero a little Greek, and there a little Arabic, because, for the expression of some thoughts, Greek or Arabic might possess a peculiarly powerful idiom. One of the most curious reflections which seem to us to grow out of the truth which Herr Engel\'s book brings into prominence, is the possibility, granting an almost infinite variety of musical scales, of the singing of birds being something far more closely related to human speech, as regards ita capacity for communicating various and definite ideas, than we are accustomed to suppose. No bird, so far as is known, sings in the established European scale; even the cuckoo\'s two notes being, according to that scale, "out of tune." But the songs of birds, the musical passages, so to speak, which they perform, are of great variety; and if we assume the possibility of the constituent parts of the performance having a meaning, there must be the materials of a possible "language of birds," whether it exist actually or not. The musical "scale" of a nation being, as we have seen, simply the form in which sound has happened to crystallise in that particular region, another branch of inquiry is suggested, though but dimly, by Mr. Engel; what it is, namely, which governs the form of crystallisation of musical sounds.... -The Gentleman\'s Magazine and Historical Review, Volume 222',

        description:
          'This fourth edition was prepared in 2015-2016 as a supplementary text for a graduate music cataloging course. This edition is rewritten to a large extent to conform to the new instructions and paradigms represented in Resource Description and Access (RDA). RDA instructions for printed music, recorded music and music video are accompanied by advice, examples, illustrations and complete catalog records, including versions in MARC21 format. Consistent with RDA, the chapter on form and choice of access points found in earlier editions is gone, replaced with a chapter on authorized access points. The concept of “uniform title” has evolved into the concept of the “preferred title,” as part of an authorized access point, which might require manipulation and addition of some elements for disambiguation and collocation. Only three chapters are used for description of printed music, sound recordings and video recordings. Many of the older LP examples were removed as were VHS video recordings. Multimedia packages are now rare in the marketplace, but streaming audio and video are quite evident so examples now include those media. Facsimile examples from the third edition have been retained and many new examples have been added. Most catalogers today are using RDA in combination with MARC21. Accordingly, in an appendix, we have rendered each example in MARC21 format using the OCLC Connexion approach to MARC21 record formatting.A lengthy bibliography in earlier editions has been replaced by a brief list in the introduction, with pointers to online resources that are both current and constantly updated by working catalogers.',

          'This book focuses on the rapidly changing sociology of music as manifested in Chinese society and Chinese education. It examines how social changes and cultural politics affect how music is currently being used in connection with the Chinese dream. While there is a growing trend toward incorporating the Chinese dream into school education and higher education, there has been no scholarly discussion to date. The combination of cultural politics, transformed authority relations, and officially approved songs can provide us with an understanding of the official content on the Chinese dream that is conveyed in today’s Chinese society, and how these factors have influenced the renewal of values-based education and practices in school music education in China.',
