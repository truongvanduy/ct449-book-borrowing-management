        "description": "Optimal Transport Methods in Economics is the first textbook on the subject written especially for students and researchers in economics. Optimal transport theory is used widely to solve problems in mathematics and some areas of the sciences, but it can also be used to understand a range of problems in applied economics, such as the matching between job seekers and jobs, the determinants of real estate prices, and the formation of matrimonial unions. This is the first text to develop clear applications of optimal transport to economic modeling, statistics, and econometrics. It covers the basic results of the theory as well as their relations to linear programming, network flow problems, convex analysis, and computational geometry. Emphasizing computational methods, it also includes programming examples that provide details on implementation. Applications include discrete choice models, models of differential demand, and quantile-based statistical estimation methods, as well as asset pricing models. Authoritative and accessible, Optimal Transport Methods in Economics also features numerous exercises throughout that help you develop your mathematical agility, deepen your computational skills, and strengthen your economic intuition. The first introduction to the subject written especially for economists Includes programming examples Features numerous exercises throughout Ideal for students and researchers alike",

        "description": "This book establishes that neoclassical economics based on the marginal utility calculus failed to derive a theory of consumer market price discovery consistent with the experimental market evidence. Such markets involve inherently discrete final-demand items bought for consumption and not subject to resale. Classical economists following Adam Smith articulated a rich narrative of price discovery theory consistent with experimental evidence based on operational concepts of discrete demand values (maximum willingness-to-pay), and symmetrically, supply costs (minimum willingness-to-accept). We develop and extend a mathematical model of classical market price formation. Chapter 1 & 2 describes this theme and chapter 3 connects it with experiments. Chapter 4 builds on experimental examples for an intuitive overview of the theory. A partial equilibrium version of the theory constitutes Chapter 5. Chapter 6 extends this framework to price formation by wealth constrained agents in multiple-goods markets. Chapter 7 applies this framework to the study of re-tradable durable-goods and financial claims that are subject to sources of instability absent in markets for consumer non-durables.",

Even economists have a problem defining economics, but there's no question that the economy and the matters we learn through economics impact our regular lives. In short, economics is the examination of the way human beings and agencies of humans use their resources. Cash, in reality, is one of those resources. However, other things can play a position in economics as nicely. Let's test the basics of economics and why you might keep analyzing this complicated discipline in mind. The field of Economics Economics is split into general classes: microeconomics and macroeconomics, and one appears at the man or woman markets at the same time as the alternative looks at an entire economy. From there, we will narrow economics into a number of the subfield of study. These include econometrics, economic development, agricultural economics, urban economics, and more.",

Economic analysis is required for various concepts such as demand, profit, cost, and competition. In this way, managerial economics is considered as economics applied to “problems of choice’’ or alternatives and allocation of scarce resources by the firms. Managerial economics is a discipline that combines economic theory with managerial practice. It helps in covering the gap between the problems of logic and the problems of policy. The subject offers powerful tools and techniques for managerial policy making. It is in this context, a textbook on introduction to the subject of Managerial Economics is presented to the students of Management program. The book contains the syllabus from basics of the subjects going into the intricacies of the subjects. All the concepts have been explained with relevant examples and diagrams to make it interesting for the readers. An attempt is made here by the experts to assist the students by way of providing case based study material as per the curriculum with non-commercial considerations. However, it is implicit that these are exam-oriented Study Material and students are advised to attend regular class room classes in the Institute and utilize reference books available in the library for In-depth knowledge. We owe to many websites and their free contents; we would like to specially acknowledge contents of website www.wikipedia.com and various authors whose writings formed the basis for this book. We acknowledge our thanks to them. At the end we would like to say that there is always a room for improvement in whatever we do.

        "description": "Economics drives the modern world and shapes our lives, but few of us feel we have time to engage with the breadth of ideas in the subject. 50 Economics Classics is the smart person's guide to two centuries of discussion of finance, capitalism and the global economy. From Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations to Thomas Piketty's bestseller Capital in the Twenty-First Century, here are the great reads, seminal ideas and famous texts, clarified and illuminated for all. The revised edition will: · include 5-6 new titles addressing some more up to date areas of the subject such as The Bitcoin Standard, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism and Discrimination and Disparities · have a revised introduction to reflect on the current turbulence and challenges facing the global economy over the next decade · have some of the less relevant titles removed 'Something of a modern classic in its own right.' E&T magazine '50 Economics Classics is a celebration of the large imaginative canvasses of the great economists. Butler-Bowdon's choices are broad, interdisciplinary and compellingly idiosyncratic. His chapters are not simply straight summaries of the chosen works, but thoughtful reflections on why we should care about this or that book and what its relevance is for us today. Butler-Bowdon's renderings are done so well that one might never bother going back to the original! Professional economists, students and general readers alike will find much here to delight in and many new byways to explore.'

Bringing together experts from various disciplines, it offers an interdisciplinary perspective on the study of relational transactions. In contrast to discrete market transactions as a traditional subject of economic discourse, the book analyses the role of relational transactions in the study of economic phenomena. The contributing authors address topics such as global intra- and inter-company networks, intersectoral stakeholder management, relational contracts, and transcultural management approaches. Accordingly, the book makes an important contribution to an emerging field of research.",

You will need to purchase a new print book to get access to the full experience including: lifetime access to the online ebook with highlight, annotation, and search capabilities, plus an outline tool and other helpful resources. Law and Economics: Theory, Cases, and Other Materials is a comprehensive introduction to the subject area of law and economics, with stimulating in depth discussion of actual case law by two leading scholars in the field. It provides a clear description of the key points of law and economics across various substantive areas of law, combining the traditional approach to the study of law and economics with new important insights from behavioral economics and competing theories. Importantly, Law and Economics artfully introduces and connects theory to practice to provide a coherent picture rather than a patch-like studying experience. Using detailed case-notes, comments and examples, Law and Economics explains why future lawyers should care about economic analysis of the law and how economics can and should play a role in litigation and conflict resolution. This important new casebook not only makes law and economics accessible to students but also indubitably establishes the importance of law and economics in a globalized world. Highlights of the First Edition: Introduces students to basic tools (e.g., game theory and decision theory) and concepts (e.g., efficiency criteria) using simple and innovative methods Facilitates the understanding of complicated concepts by providing the theoretical backgrounds as well as clear explanations, examples, exercises, and comprehensive comments and notes that do not require any background in math or economics Allows readers to test their understanding by providing practice questions with full answers Carefully selected cases, with discussion emphasizing the economic rationales underlying decisions and demonstrating how these rationales impact decisions Marries the virtues of a textbook (explaining the theoretical underpinning of different economic notions and how they relate to different legal doctrines) to those of a casebook by tying concepts to actual decisions Adopts a modern approach that covers competing theories as they relate to specific decisions and theories Includes methodology chapters where the same methodology (e.g., decision making, game theory, supply and demand) is used to analyze different areas of the law, as well as subject matter chapters in which specific areas of the law (e.g., property) are analyzed using different methodologies A modular structure, allowing the professor to pick and cover materials in almost any order, to skip certain materials and to focus on court decisions, the theory, or both Professors and students will benefit from: The use of alternative intuitive methods to explain theories The use of simple algebra to teach the most complex subjects The artful combination of theory with a practical approach that ties the economic concepts (including game theory and decision theory) to specific subject matters, legal rules and specific decisions In-depth discussion of decisions and how they could they be explained or argued differently in light of the theoretical concepts reviewed The use of summary boxes to recap complicated concepts Fantastic notes and practical questions following cases",

        "description": "Traditional economics is built on the assumption of self-interested individuals seeking to maximize personal gain, but that is far from the whole story. Sharing, caring, and a desire to uphold the collective good are also powerful motives. In a world wracked by inequality, social divisions, and ecological destruction, can we build an alternative economics based on cooperation? In this book Chris Benner and Manuel Pastor invite us to imagine a new sort of solidarity economics – an approach grounded in our instincts for connection and community – and in so doing, actually build a more robust and sustainable economy. They argue that our current economy is already deeply dependent on mutuality, but that the inequality and fragmentation created by the status quo undermine this mutuality and with it our economic well-being. They outline the theoretical framing, policy agenda, and social movements that we need to revive solidarity and apply it to whole societies. Solidarity Economics is an essential read for anyone who longs for a fairer economy that can generate prosperity and preserve the planet.",

        "description": "Metrology is the study of measurement science. Although classical economists have emphasized the importance of measurement per se, the majority of economics-based writings on the topic have taken the form of government reports related to the activities of specific national metrology laboratories. This book is the first systematic study of measurement activity at a national metrology laboratory, and the laboratory studied is the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) within the U.S. Department of Commerce. The primary objective of the book is to emphasize for academic and policy audiences the economic importance of measurement not only as an area of study but also as a tool for sustaining technological advancement as an element of economic growth. Toward this goal, the book offers an overview of the economic benefits and consequences of measurement standards; an argument for public sector support of measurement standards; a historical perspective of the measurement activities at NIST; an empirical analysis of one particular measurement activity at NIST, namely calibration testing; and a roadmap for future research on the economics of metrology.",

        "description": "Master's Thesis from the year 2021 in the subject Economics - Economic Cycle and Growth, grade: 3.75 (good), Ethiopian Civil Service University, language: English, abstract: This paper is about the effect of international remittances of economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa. For many developing economies, remittances constitute the single largest source of foreign exchange, exceeding export revenues, foreign direct investment (FDI), and other private capital inflows. This study aims to examine the effect of international remittances on economic growth in SSA countries using a panel data approach. The System Generalized Method of Moments was used as the main model of analysis. The sample consists of 29 SSA countries for the period 2004-2019. The study findings show that international remittance has a positive and significant effect on economic growth in SSA. The study recommends that SSA countries should be designing policies and strategies that facilitate less costly and hassle-free flow of remittances into national development. There is a need to have well-established institutional frameworks to train, support, and ensure the welfare of emigrants abroad by the provision of information or services to assist migrant welfare and promote remittances and investment in the home country.",

        "description": "The book compares neoclassical and Marxian economics and points out that both the schools of thought seek to analyze how a capitalist society functions. The authors show that the neoclassical economics vindicates capitalism and prescribes policies that further the interest of the rich (giant capitalists), who own most of the non-human productive resources of the economy, whereas Marxian analysis yields the result that a capitalist society is exploitative and crisis-prone. Marxian economics also suggests that the class struggle inherent in a capitalist society will eventually transform it into an equal, just and humane socialist society The book also presents Keynesian theory, which suggests measures that can counter at least some of the crises that Marx said a capitalist country is subject to. It discusses the current state of the capitalist world, the recent crises it was subject to and assesses the three theories in the light of these experiences. It recounts the current states of two important socialist states, namely, China and Cuba. It discusses the economic performance of Soviet Union since its birth and explains the reasons for its disintegration. It compares economic performances of the capitalist and the socialist states and assesses in the light of the experiences of these two blocs of countries which school of thought is more acceptable and closer to the truth.",

This comprehensive textbook explains the concepts necessary to understand, evaluate, and address the economic problems and issues the nations of the world are currently facing, and are likely to face in the future. Balancing depth and accessibility, the text helps students identify the real-world relevance of the material through extensive practical applications and examples. The new, thoroughly-updated and expanded edition provides students with a solid knowledgebase in international trade theory and policy, balance of payments, foreign exchange markets and exchange rates, open-economy macroeconomics, and the international monetary system. The text uniquely employs the same graphical and numerical model in chapters that cover the same basic concept, allowing students to recognize the relationship among the different topics without having to start with a new example each time. Clear, straightforward discussions of each key concept and theory are complemented by concrete, accessible, and relatable examples that serve to strengthen student comprehension and retention. Topics include the ‘Great Recession,’ the increase in trade protectionism, excessive volatility and large misalignments of exchange rates, and the impacts of resource scarcity and climate change to continued growth and sustainable development.",

        "publisher": "Routledge",
        "publishedDate": "2019-07-16",
        "description": "The economics of the Arts is a new field with a small but rapidly-growing literature, which has emerged in recent years out of the eagerness of economists to apply their techniques to hitherto untried areas and the recognition by Arts administrators of the rapidly increasing economic pressures on the Arts. This book of readings is the first of its kind. Of the 16 articles, 8 are directly concerned with the Arts in America; the other 8 deal with the British scene. What can economics say about so non-economic a subject as the Arts? Obviously, finance for the Arts involves economic considerations. But in addition, economics provides, among other things, a logic of rational choice, and the economists' style of thinking, therefore, is adaptable to any problem of choice in respect of any set of goals, whether they be economic goals or not. Then, there is the question of whether economics can provide a case for public support for the Arts, that is, whether the State should subsidize the Arts. This is a familiar problem in the economics of welfare but its application to the Arts raises novel questions and even economists are not agreed on whether economics can provide such a rationale. Also, there is the question of criteria for public expenditure on the Arts, assuming that the case for some public expenditure has been made. Can economists tell us how much the State should spend on the Arts? Surely, they can help us with a host of other questions: should museums and galleries charge fees; should museums ever sell off parts of their collections; can the Arts economize on their expenditures; how can modern music be most effectively encouraged by public funds; are ticket prices an important element in the demand for the Arts; and does the low pay of artists discourage individuals from taking up artistic occupations?",

        "description": "This book examines the nature of economic objects that form the subject matter of economics, and studies how they resemble or differ from the objects studied by the natural sciences. It explores the question of whether economic objects created by modern economics sufficiently represent economic reality, and confronts the question whether tools, techniques and the methodology borrowed from the natural sciences are appropriate for the analysis of economic reality. It demonstrates the unsustainability of rational choice theory. It looks at economic agents, such as individuals, groups, legally constituted entities, algorithms, or robots, how they function and how they are represented in economics. The volume further examines the extent, if any, that mathematics can represent the objects of the economy, such as supply and demand, equilibrium, marginal utility, or the money supply as they actually occur in the economy, and as they are represented in economics. Finally, the volume explores whether the subject matter of economics – however defined – is the proper subject of theoretical knowledge, whether economics is an analytic or a descriptive discipline, or if it is more properly seen in the domain of practical reason. Specifically, the book looks at the importance and the ambiguity of the ontology of modern economics, temporality, reflexivity, the question of incommensurability, and their implications for economic policy.",
